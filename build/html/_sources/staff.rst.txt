* **Mohammad Alian** - Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas
    Mohammad Alian is an Assistant Professor at the EECS department of the University of Kansas. Before joining KU, he completed his Ph.D. and MS at UIUC and UW-Madison, respectively. At UIUC, he developed dist-gem5 and MCN. dist-gem5 is part of the official gem5 release and MCN is the precursor to the development of Samsung's AxDIMM. His team at KU got second place Samsung open innovation contest for AxDIMM technology. Four best paper candidacies have recognized his research in top computer architecture conferences, including MICRO 2018 and HPCA 2017, and an honorable mention in IEEE Micro Top Picks 2017. He is a co-PIs of the SRC/DARPA JUMP 2.0 ACE Center for Evolvable Computing aiming at transforming the distributed computing of the next decade. Mohammad's research explores opportunities in the intersection of computer architecture and networking to shape the future of data centeric computing.

* **Johnson Umeike** - PhD Student, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas
    Johnson is a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at the University of Kansas. I earned my B.Eng. degree from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) in Nigeria. My research interests are in computer architecture, operating systems, computer networking, high-performance computing, and emerging technologies. In my work with the Architecture Research Group, I have explored the optimization of software architectural simulators to enable efficient computer design and reduce energy costs. I am also working on "Device-less Networking" which investigates efficient CPU designs for improved I/O performance. I am advised by Dr. Mohammad Alian. Skill Set: C++, C, python, system modeling, and performance evaluation.

* **Derrick Quinn** - Undergraduate Student, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas
    I will be completing my undergraduate studies at the University of Kansas in May 2023 with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I am excited to be starting my Ph.D. program in Computer Science at KU this fall. My primary research interests lie in the fields of Computer Architecture and Accelerated Computing/HPC, with current research projects in Accelerated HPC Networking, as well as in the Modeling of Accelerated Systems. My language and platform of choice is Rust on Linux or MacOS, though I am also proficient in other programming languages such as C, Python, and shell scripting.
