About
==================

Lab Vision
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The computation in future datacenters will be distributed over a heterogenous array of processing elements, packaged modularly within a server's boundaries. The inter- and intra-server data movement will bottleneck such a computing landscape. The vision of my research is to seamlessly integrate processor, memory, and network architecture through a co-design with operating systems, network software stack, and software libraries to minimize the data movement in future datacenters.
